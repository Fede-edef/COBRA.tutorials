%% Creation and simulation of personalized microbiota models trough metagenomic data integration
%% Author: Federico Baldini, Molecular Systems Physiology Group, University of Luxembourg.
%% INTRODUCTION
% This tutorial shows the steps that MgPipe automatically performs to create 
% and simulate personalized microbiota models trough metagenomic data integration.
% 
% The pipeline is divided in 3 parts:
% 
% # *[PART 1]* Analysis of individuals' specific microbes abundances is computed. 
% Individuals' metabolic diversity in relation to microbiota size and disease 
% presence as well as Classical multidimensional scaling (PCoA) on individuals' 
% reaction repertoire are examples.
% # *[PART 2]*: 1 Constructing a global metabolic model (setup) containing all 
% the microbes listed in the study. 2 Building individuals' specific models integrating 
% abundance data retrieved from metagenomics. For each organism, reactions are 
% coupled to their objective function. 
% # *[PART 3]* A specific range of growth is imposed for each microbiota model 
% and Simulations under specific diet regimes are carried. Set of standard analysis 
% to apply to the personalized models. PCA of computed MNPCs of individuals as 
% for example.
%% USAGE
% Normally, once provided all the input variables in the driver (StartMgPipe), 
% the only action required is to run the driver itself. However, for the purposes 
% of this tutorial, we will disable the autorun functionality and compute each 
% section manually. 
%% DRIVER
% This file has to be modified from the user in order to launch the pipeline 
% and to define inputs and outputs files and locations. 
%% 

% We first set the paths to input and output files
initCobraToolbox()
% path to microbe models
modPath='YOUR_PATH_TO_AGORA\';
% % path where to save results
resPath='YOUR PATH TO RESULT FOLDER\' ;
% path to where the COBRA Toolbox is located
global CBTDIR
toolboxPath=CBTDIR;
% path to and name of the file with dietary information. Here, 
% we will use an "Average European" diet that is located in the 
% DietImplementation folder.
dietFilePath=[CBTDIR filesep 'papers' filesep '2017_AGORA' filesep 'resourceForMicrobiomeModelingToolbox' filesep 'AverageEuropeanDiet'];
%% 
% Then we set the path and the name of the file from which to load the abundances. 
% For this tutorial, in order to reduce the time of computations, we will use 
% a reduced version of the example file (normCoverageReduced.csv) provided in 
% the folder Resources: only 4 individuals and 30 strains will be considered. 
% Plese note that abundances are normalized to a total sum of one. 

abunFilePath=[CBTDIR filesep 'tutorials' filesep 'additionalTutorials' filesep 'microbiomeModelingToolbox' filesep 'normCoverageReduced.csv'];
%% 
% Next inputs will define:
% 
% # name of objective function of organisms
% # format to use to save images
% # number of cores to use for the pipeline execution 
% # if to enable automatic detection and correction of possible bugs
% # if to enable compatibility mode 
% # if health status for individuals is provided 
% # if to simulate also a rich diet
% # if if to use an external solver and save models with diet
% # the type of FVA function to use to solve 
% 
% The following setting should work for almost any system, but please check 
% carefully to be sure these options are valid for you. A more detailed description 
% of these variables is available in the documentation. 
% 
% The same inputs need to be set in the driver file StartMgPipe when running 
% MgPipe outside of this tutorial or directly in the "initMgPipe" function.

% name of objective function of organisms
objre={'EX_biomass(e)'};
% the output is vectorized picture, change to '-dpng' for .png
figForm = '-depsc';
% number of cores dedicated for parallelization
numWorkers = 3;
% autofix for names mismatch
autoFix = 1 
% if outputs in open formats should be produced for each section (1=T)
compMod = 0;
% if documentations on patient health status is provided (0 not 1 yes)
patStat = 0; 
% to enable also rich diet simulations 
rDiet = 0; 
% if if to use an external solver and save models with diet
extSolve = 0; 
% the type of FVA function to use to solve
fvaType = 1; 
% To tourn off the autorun to be able to manually execute each part of the pipeline.
autorun=0;

% In case PART 1 was not computed we will compute it now. We will first 
% load the models and create a cell array containing them. This cell array will 
% be used as input by many functions in the pipeline. Any possible constraint 
% from each model reactions will be removed. Moreover we will run and subsequentially 
% plot the results of some analysis that are computed. The main outputs are:
% 
% # *Metabolic diversity* The number of mapped organisms for each individual 
% compared to the total number of unique reactions (extrapolated by the number 
% of reactions of each organism) 
% # *Classical multidimensional scaling of each individual reactions repertoire*

%% PIPELINE: [PART 3]
% 
% In this phase, for each microbiota model, a diet, in the form of set constraints 
% to the exchanges reactions of the diet compartment, is integrated. Flux Variability 
% analysis for all the exchange reactions of the diet and fecal compartment is 
% also computed and saved in a file called "simRes". Specifically what computed and saved are:
%
% # *ID* a vector containing the names of metabolites for which FVA of exchange reactions was computed
% # *fvaCt* a cell array containing min  flux trough uptake and max trough secretion  exchanges (later used for  computing NMPCs)
% # *nsCT* a cell array containing max  flux trough uptake and min trough secretion  exchanges
% # *presol* an array containing the value of objectives for each microbiota model with rich and selected diet
% # *inFesMat* cell array containing the names of the microbiota models that reported an infeasible status when solved for their objective  

[ID,fvaCt,nsCt,presol,inFesMat]=microbiotaModelSimulator(resPath,setup,sampName,dietFilePath,rDiet,0,extSolve,patNumb,fvaType)
%% 
% Finally, NMPCs (net maximal production capability) are computed in a metabolite 
% resolved manner and saved in a comma delimited file in the results folder. NMPCs 
% indicate the maximal production of each metabolite and are computing summing 
% the maximal secretion flux with the maximal uptake flux. Similarity of metabolic 
% profiles (using the different NMPCs as features) between individuals are also 
% evaluated with classical multidimensional scaling.
